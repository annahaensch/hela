# Hela HMM Toolkit

This repository contains various code related to hidden Markov models (HMM).  For a technical overview of HMM, see this note on [Inference and Imputation for Hidden Markov Models with Hybrid State Outputs](This repository contains code for hidden Markov modeling).   

## Getting Started 

This code is packaged as a docker container, so before you can interact with Hela, you'll need to do a few things: 

1. Install Docker ([available here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)), or if you think you might already have in installed, run `docker --version` from you terminal command line.
2. Install and configure Git and ([instructions here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)), if if you thin you already have in installed, run `git --version` from your terminal command line.
3. _Recommended:_ Make sure you are prepared to connect to Github with SSH ([instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)).
